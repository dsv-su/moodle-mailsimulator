<h1>Weight</h1>

<p>Weights are used to assist in the grading, the weight determines how much a mail is worth.</p>
<p>If a student has given a Good answer the weight is multiplied by 2, if the answer is OK multiply the weight by 1 and if the answer is Fail multiply the weight with 0.</p>

<p>Example of an assignment with three mail:<br />
5 (w) x 2 (Good) = 10<br />
3 (w) x 1 (OK) = 3<br />
4 (w) x 0 (Fail) = 0<br />
<br />
Total weight is 13 out of 24 possible.</p>
